# Tutorial: five_model_adversarial

This project aims to **detect adversarial attacks** by analyzing data. It *loads and cleans* the input dataset, then *engineers new features*, including some specific to data 'layers' to enhance predictive power. Multiple *machine learning models are trained*, and their settings (hyperparameters) are *optimized using GridSearchCV*. These trained models are then *comprehensively evaluated and compared* based on various performance metrics. Finally, the project *visualizes these evaluation results* through plots and *saves the best-performing model*, along with detailed reports and generated artifacts.
