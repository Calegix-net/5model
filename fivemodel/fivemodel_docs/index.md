# Tutorial: fivemodel

This project, `fivemodel`, focuses on **building and analyzing machine learning models** to classify data, for instance, distinguishing 'normal' from 'adversarial' activities.
It features a pipeline that starts with a *CSV Data Combiner* to unify raw data. A *Feature Engineering Engine* then cleans this data and creates new, meaningful features.
These features feed into a *Machine Learning Model Training Pipeline* that trains various classification algorithms like RandomForest and XGBoost.
The performance of these models is then thoroughly checked by a *Model Performance Evaluator & Reporter*.
Finally, the project includes advanced tools like *Feature Importance Analysis* for model interpretability and refinement, a *Targeted Feature Set Comparison Framework* for focused experiments, and a *RandomForest Ablation Study System* to assess the impact of feature groups.
