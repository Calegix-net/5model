# Tutorial: explanation

This project simulates **Federated Learning (FL)** environments to generate experimental data. This data, which includes metrics like model *weight statistics* from different clients and rounds (possibly under attack conditions), is then collected and organized into a comprehensive dataset. Subsequently, this dataset powers a machine learning pipeline designed to train and evaluate various **anomaly detection models**. The core goal is to effectively identify malicious activities or *attacks* occurring within the simulated FL processes. The project also focuses on optimizing these models through *hyperparameter tuning*, understanding which *features* are most important via techniques like *ablation studies*, and comparing different model performances.
