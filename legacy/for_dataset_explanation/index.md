# Tutorial: for_dataset

This project *simulates* **federated learning**, where multiple *participants* (clients) collaboratively train a machine learning model on their respective *private data* without sharing it. The system focuses on **archiving and meticulously analyzing** the internal **model weights** from these clients throughout the simulation. An *automated experiment conductor* script repeatedly runs this entire simulation process, gathers comprehensive statistics about the model weights and training performance from each run, and then organizes these findings into **structured CSV files** for detailed review and further analysis.
